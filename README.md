- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LiamWaters2023
- This project is shared within my resume for recruiters / potential employers.
- The program automates the arbitrage between an ETF (listed on two different exchanges and currencies, CAD & USD) and the underlying stocks(denominated in CAD);
- In addition it trades private tender offers while controlling for volatility and market risks.
- Part of the competition involved manually using the client to control liquidity risk via the usage of ETF creation / redemption.
- I've integrated decision making and prompts within the code so I could efficiently (and profitably) control for liquidity risk.
